# Infectious Disease Simulation

This repository contains a NetLogo-based simulation to model the spread of an infectious disease across two populations. It allows you to explore various factors that influence the dynamics of disease transmission, such as population density, social distancing, immunity, survival rates, and more.

## Features
- Simulates disease spread in two populations.
- Adjustable parameters including population density, travel restrictions, and immunity levels.
- Visualizes infection, recovery, and death rates over time.
- Allows export of simulation data for further analysis.

## Requirements
- [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) (Download and install the latest version of NetLogo)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Infectious-Disease-Simulation.git
   ```

2. Open the `.nlogo` file in NetLogo.

3. Adjust the parameters (e.g., population density, social distancing) as desired.

4. Run the simulation to observe how the disease spreads and its impact on the population.
